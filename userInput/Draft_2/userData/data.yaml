      p1blSec2Text1: According to a recent survey by the MLS, 78% of all homes did not sell
                    with the agent the sellers chose to list with the first time. This same
                    survey reveals that 61% of these same sellers failed to sell their home
                    again when they relisted with the same agent. This has led to over 23
                    billion dollars in lost income for these home sellers.
                    It will cost you nothing to discuss this sale with me but not calling me,
                    according to the survey referred to above, it could be hazardous to your
                    bank account.

                    There is a difference in real estate agents, the services they provide and
                    the results you get. You owe it to yourself to see first-hand the
                    difference that can benefit you.
